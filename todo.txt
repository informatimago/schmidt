** TODO [#A] Drag-and-Drop of DesktopElement                             :ui:

Using a UIImageView to drag and drop:

- the subviews are not drawn in the image.

- moving on the desktop is possible only to outside of any view: we
  cannot easily offset a dekstop item.

We should re-implement it by removing the view being dragged from its
superview, adding it to the DesktopView, and dragging there, then
moving it back (cancel), moving it back and duplicate to target (copy)
or inserting to target (move).
