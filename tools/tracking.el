;; Paragraphs starting with "[Lnnnn]" and ending with "Â¶" are tracable
;; specification elements.  They may be extracted automatically to feed
;; a tracing database.  They may be duplicated (same [Snnnn]  number) for
;; legibility of the text.
;; 
;; Note: within the brackets, there may be several S-numbers separated
;; with dots, representing a hierachical dependency path.  A S-number may
;; have several dependents ("parents") in the graph: the same
;; specification items is reused in the specification of the parent item.
;; 
;; Only the last S-number identifies the specification item (paragraph).
