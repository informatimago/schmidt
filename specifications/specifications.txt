Specifications MIDI Librarian
############################################################



The `MIDI Librarian` application lets the user edit sets and banks of
programs, to save sysex files (.syx) containing programs, banks or
sets, and when possible, to communicate with the MIDI synthesizer to
transfer programs, banks or sets, either in batch or during
interactive use.

Additionnal entities may be edited, to help organizing programs, banks
and sets off-line.




::

    entry ::= directory | program-file .
    directory ::= name { entry } .
    program-file ::= name { program } .
    program ::= name category data .
    bank ::= number 256* program .
    set  :=  8* bank . -- unique bank numbers.y

    category ::= name color .
    categories ::= 64* category . -- unique colors.





Functionalities
------------------------------------------------------------



For the Schmidt Synthesizer, the `categories` are names given to the
predefined set of colors (0â€¦63).  `Categories` are lists of 64 names.
Each `Set` has it own list of `Categories`, initialized with the
default list.


- Edit the list of default categories:
   - select the default list of categories.
   - select a category in the default list.
   - edit its name.

- Edit the list of categories of a Set:
   - select a Set.
   - select the list of categories.
   - select a category in the default list.
   - edit its name.




Currently, we can only transfer single banks or multi banks manually.
Sending or receiving a whole set requires 16 manual operations (8
single banks, and 8 multi banks).

Therefore we will provide the basic functionality of sending and
receiving banks.  Sending a Set will involve sending the 16 banks with
manual synchronization.

- Configure MIDI: select the MIDI bus and the Send and Receive MIDI Channels.

- Listen for Sysex messages to automatically initiate the reception of banks.

- Listen for program changes and NPRN messages to automatically update the current program.
