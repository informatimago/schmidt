Schimdt_Manual_E_121_Web.pdf Errata
========================================

- In the MIDI parameter sections, several occurences of the mapping for
  oscillators contain a typo "Osz2" for "Osz3":

    00: Osz1
    01: Osz2
    10: Osz2
    11: Osz4

- Everywhere, the second unit shall be written in lower case, for example: 2ms…21s

- Several occurences of "Dacay2" --> "Decay 2"

- page 110: Apparently, the DF2 section header is missing; the
  parameters from the bottom of this page from Velocity 126, and top
  of page 111 seem to be related to DF2.


- Glide/bend Pitch Bend ranges are not disjoint!  1…28 should probably be 15…28.

- Missing a section explaining the format of the SysEx messages, such as:

    !!! ADD SysEx DOC HERE !!!

MIDI Implementation
----------------------------------------

It would be useful to provide several sysex message to be able to
command program and bank reading and writing (dumping and
reception/saving), so that a librarian software may be implemented.

- The MIDI sysex messages to request programs (single, multi) and banks dumps are not specified.
- The MIDI sysex messages to command writing a program or a bank are not specified.
- The format of the MIDI sysex bank dumps message is not specified.
