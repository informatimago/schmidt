* Introduction

This document analyses a MIDI Librarian for the Schmidt Synthesizer.

** Structure of this document

Paragraphs starting with "[Annnn]" and ending with "¶" are tracable
specification elements.  They may be extracted automatically to feed
a tracing database.  They may be duplicated (same [Annnn]  number) for
legibility of the text.

Note: within the brackets, there may be several tag numbers separated
with dots, representing a hierachical dependency path.  A tag number may
have several dependents ("parents") in the graph: the same
specification items is reused in the specification of the parent item.

Only the last tag number identifies the specification item (paragraph).

Tag numbers starting with "S" refer the *specification* document.
Tag numbers starting with "A" refer to the *analysis* document.

The [Snnnn] numbers have some structure:

** Functionalities

*** [S1000.A1000] Display Current Program Parameters ¶

[A1000.A1001] When the synthesizer is connected, there must be a
current Program, a current Bank, and current BankSet, to receive the
updates from NPRN messages.¶

[A1000.A1002] Selecting a current program should make a working copy
of the program data, since the user may edit it with the control
panel, but not save it.¶

[A1002.A1020] Synthesizer has a current BankSet (with Banks and
Programs), and a current Bank/Program index, and a current working
Program.¶

[S1110.A1011] Upon reception of a program change event:

    - update the current Bank/Program index of the Synthesizer;

    - copy the parameters of the indicated current Bank/Program index
      of the Synthesizer into the current working Program of the
      Synthesizer;

    - query the parameters of the current program from the
      Synthesizer.

    - If possible and upon reception of the parameters, update the
      current working Program.

    - If not possible, then the current working Program parameters
      already have parameters obtained from the local current Program
      of the Synthesizer.
¶

[S1120.A1013] display the program parameters. ¶

TBD see how to represent the program parameters graphically, showing
notably the setting of the knobs, which is not reflected on the
physical dead knobs.  This display of the preset settings should be
graphical (eg. envelops) and calibrated (for times and periods), to
aid visualising the sound that would be generated. ¶


The Schmidt Synthesizer doesn't take command sysex message like
eg. the Korg synthesizers.

The only MIDI messages that are sent or received by the Schmidt
Synthesizer are:

NRPN MSB=127 & LSB=127 > subsequent Data-Entry are ignored.


In addition, the Schmidt Synthesizer may receive or send single or
multi preset banks, but user intervention on the synthesizer is
required to initiate the transfer of a bank, or store the received
presets into a bank.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Schmidt Synthesizer is always ready to receive SysEx data,
respectively Single preset banks and Multi preset banks. If the
Schmidt Synthesizer recognize incoming SysEx Data, it temporarily
saves them into a memory bfufer an dasks if and where the data should
be saved permanently.

To receive Single preset banks, Single mode has to be
enabled.

To receive Multi preset banks, Multi mode has to be enabled.

Otherwise the SysEx data is ignored.

If the Schmidt Synthesizer recive suitable SysEx data, the LCD show a
progress bar.  The user may select Exit to cancel.

As soon as teh data reception is complete, the screen propose the user
to store the received bank.
The user can use the Bank up/Bank down buttons to select the target
present bank, and the Enter button to confirm, or the Exit button to
cancel.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Send MIDI Dump let the user send banks.  Depending on the mode
Single or Multi, a Single or a Multi preset bank can be sent.

The user selects the bank with the Bank up/Bank down butons, then
initiates the transfer with the Enter button, or cancel with the Exit
button.

Once the transfer is completed, the user may send again, or exit.
#+END_QUOTE

There is no way to command saving an edited program with MIDI
messages.  But thru the use of the CC and NPRN messages, we can
maintain the mirroring of the current program between the synthesizer
and the librarian (assuming we started with the same parameter,
obtained by the prior transfer of the bank, and the selection of the
program with the Program Change MIDI message (in either direction).




*** [S2000.A2000] Editing

- [S2000] *editing*: some preset editing is provided, but we don't
  want to replace the physical button and knob editing that is the
  strong point of a control panel such as the one of the *Schmidt
  Synthesizer*.  On the other hand, preset renaming, changing or
  copying parameters globally to a group of presets, applying editing
  macros to one or multiple presets, for sophisticated editing, are
  features that should be provided. ¶
